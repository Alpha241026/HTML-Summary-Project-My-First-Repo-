Hi everyone...I joined GitHub in May as I learnt it was going to be necessary for someone getting into the IT industry...but to be honest I kept procrastinating about pushing my first repo because I wasn't sure what 
my first GitHub project be XD...that said, given the current situation; my Class Assessments have nearly ended and I'll have Mid Semester Exams in a just a week...after which I'm supposed to show my GitHub account 
and repos to the Orientation to Computing (CSE 111) for grading (it shouldn't be empty)...so I found a good reason to actually start posting here...and without overthinking any farther I decided to create a HTML 
project which will show all the tags I have lernt in my HTML classes. Well then, without furthur ado...let me list the tags used...for convenience -
